    Coming into this class, I didn't really understand what we would be learning. But, as we have been in class for a couple weeks,
    I am excited to learn about ASP.NET applications and how to code in new languages. I hope to get a lot out of this class, including
    new skills and programming languages. I know this is going to be a fun class!
